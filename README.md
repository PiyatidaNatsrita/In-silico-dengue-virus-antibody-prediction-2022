This github repository is for our paper "Machine-learning-assisted high-throughput computational prediction of potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies against dengue virus" published in Scientific Reports. To read the paper please visit the following link: /****/

# Dataset
We prepared a dataset of dengue antibodies that satisfied with the following criteria: 1) having complete CDR-H3 amino acid sequences targeting to DENV and published on PubMed 2) having epitopes on E protein with the resolution of “residue” or “truncated domain” 3) having neutralizing activities against DENV in the unit of µg/ml, which are characterized by focus reduction neutralization assay or plaque reduction neutralization assay. 

# Method
We used ... More details about the methods can be found in the paper.
